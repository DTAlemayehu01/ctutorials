#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

//remember we can declare both classes and functions up top

int main()
{
	
	return 0;	
}

//and then we can define classes and functions at the bottom
//class function defintition looks like
//	class_name::classfunction(parameters){
//		definition;
//	}

//The "::" is called a resolution operator

//Anyways remember the three file split for large projects
//Header file for declarations ".hpp"
//Impletmentation file for definitions ".cpp"
//Driver file for execution ".cpp"
