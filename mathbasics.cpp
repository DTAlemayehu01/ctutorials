//integers can be positive and negative
//you can +,-,*,/ e.g. x + y with eval to x+y total
//there is %
//c++ follows pemdas
//++ adds 1 to a number, +=x adds +x to a variable
//doing math with all integers always prints an integer 
//doing math with any decimal will print the answer as a decimal
//improved math functions can be imported with <cmath>
//pow(x, y) does x^y
//sqrt(x,y) does x^1/y
//round(x) rounds x to nearest int
//ceil(x) rounds up to closest int
//fmax(x,y) returns bigger number fmin() does opposite
