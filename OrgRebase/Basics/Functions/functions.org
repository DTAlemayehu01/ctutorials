* Objective: Learn about functions in C++
Here we'll learn more about ~int main()~ and how we segment code in ~C++~
* Making a Function
When making a new function, one must consider the three following items:
- Parameters: what inputs should the function require before executing
- Code: what should the function do with those inputs, if any
- Return: should the function finish and come back with a ~bool~ evaluation? what about a string? or what if the function doesn't need to return anything at all?
* int main()
