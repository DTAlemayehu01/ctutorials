* Objective: Understand the primary standard libraries in C++
Here we'll go over the primarily used and generally useful libaries in C++.
* Basic Libraries
** IOStream - a library for the console, taking in and printing information
We've primarily used ~std::cout~ and ~std::endl~ to output to the console. But we can also take in user input from the console utilizing ~std::cin~
** FStream - a library for reading and outputing to files
** CMath - a library for advanced arithmetic operations
** CCType - a library for checking the Type of data in C++.
* Advanced Libraries
** Stack - an implementation of the Stack DS
** Queue - an implementation of the Queue DS
