- [ ] Heading Links, ToC to other org files
- [X] Introduction
- [ ] Contribution
* TODO Fix Errors in Branches [1/40]
- [X] arrays.cpp
  matrix references item out of bounds, fixed in OrgRebase branch
- [ ] Check all org files for proper referencing
- [ ] Check all cpp files for good practices
- [ ] Make note in readme for <<>> text in cpp
- [ ] Hello-World.org not displaying cpp output
  so i can't use the export option to display both #+Results: and the code if both are under different headings, I fixed this for now by making an extra code block at the bottom that only exports results, I might remove the headings in this org file
- [ ] Get 4th level heading to appear in ToC of variables.org
- [ ] Explain multivariable declaration in c++
- [ ] Edit various abiguous variable files to utilize cin, rather than expecting user to edit code files themselves.
- [ ] Utilize, realistic applications for loops in loops.org? Or apply that in functions?
- [ ] Implement Advanced libraries in C++ tutorial
- [ ] Integrate getline explaination()
- [ ] Rename all subfolder lines to readme.org
- [ ] Reformat code block in libaries.org for vector explaination
- [ ] Fix BST Insert
  - It should return currNode upon finishing the node->left or node->right iteration
- [ ] There's a reference to a previous section in the libraries section of the repo, perhaps learn to use cross reference linking to link to previous section?
- [ ] Expand linking and backlinking relations for each org file
- [ ] Make notes on ~namespace~ and ~using namespace std;~
- [ ] Make notes on how getline can mess up/common pitfalls
- [ ] Make something on macro definitions
- [ ] Consider making CPP libaries it's own section or split into basic libraries for basic section, advanced libraries for advanced section, etc.
- [ ] Expand on declarations and definitions of functions and such in C++?
- [ ] functions.org might require more headings?
- [ ] Possible separate the data structures notes from the basics?
- [ ] Learn about exception handling?
- [ ] Figure out solution for "cin"
- [ ] Add to libraries a note on "cin.fail()"
- [ ] Functions.org might need headings
- [ ] I have a "more on that later" thing in functions.org
  Maybe declare an order of reading? That might defeat the purpose of the study guide nature of this repo
- [ ] In functions.org i say "all cli args are strings" this might not be necesarily correct and requires review
- [ ] I need to check to make sure each tangled file is valid code because org-babel is limited and won't let me evaluate certain code
- [ ] Explain #indef and #define
- [ ] Explain function recursion
- [ ] Go more indepth in debuggers.md
- [ ] Add on to properties of Stacks and Graphs in stacks.org and graphs.org
- [ ] TEST dijsktraTraversal in graphs.org
- [ ] CHECK DFT in graph.org
- [ ] Create search() in graph.org
- [ ] FIX BUGS (View Through Emacs) in tangled graph.hpp and graph.cpp files
- [ ] Write minheapify func
- [ ] Write swap function
