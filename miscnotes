//note the verticies.size function in a vector runs every time each instance of the for loop is called so we assign it to a constant var to reduce runtime
		//reminder we're using pointers here because when vectors resize themselves the memory addresses change locaation so the adjacency list would be pointing to incorrect pointers
		//it's also just generally less memory intensive/more efficient
