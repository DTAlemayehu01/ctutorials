# include <iostream>

//instead of using endl to print new line you can use \n for in string line breaks
//c (and iostream?) come with functions like .length() for a string length
//functions are called on vars using a . operator btw
//you can reference a specific character in a string variable by using index positions (e.g. string vars = "pp" , vars[0] refers to the first letter in the string p
//pass parameters to a function with .function(parameter1,parameter2)
//x.find(string,starti index) finds the starting index point the first instance of a string x occurs starting by seraching from the start index
//x.substring(index,#) stores a string starting with string x[index] and up to #characters counting from the index

using namespace std;
int main() {
	cout << "Mr. Watson, come here!" << endl;
	return 0;
}
//for problem 00
//essentially hello world
//remember to compile!
